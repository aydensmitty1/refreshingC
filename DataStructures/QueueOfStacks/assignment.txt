3. Designing a Queue Using Two Stacks
Problem: Implement a queue in C using two stacks. The queue should support standard operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and checking if the queue is empty. 
Optimize the implementation so that each operation runs in amortized O(1) time.

Challenge Points:

Managing two stacks to simulate queue behavior.
Ensuring that elements are dequeued in the correct order (FIFO) despite using LIFO stacks.
Handling edge cases such as dequeuing from an empty queue.
Optimizing the transfer of elements between stacks to achieve amortized O(1) time per operation.
