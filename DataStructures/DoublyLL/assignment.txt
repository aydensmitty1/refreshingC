1. Implementing a Doubly Linked List with Advanced Operations
Problem: Create a doubly linked list in C that supports the following operations:

Insertion at the beginning, end, and at a specific position.
Deletion from the beginning, end, and a specific position.
Reversal of the list.
Searching for an element and returning its position.
Displaying the list from both head to tail and tail to head.

Challenge Points:

Managing both prev and next pointers correctly during insertions and deletions.
Handling edge cases such as empty lists, single-node lists, and invalid positions.
Efficiently reversing the list by updating pointers without creating a new list.
Ensuring no memory leaks by properly freeing deleted nodes.
