4. Implementing a Hash Table (Dictionary) with Chaining for Collision Resolution
Problem: Create a hash table (dictionary) in C that maps string keys to integer values. 
Use chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions. The hash table should support the following operations:

Insertion of key-value pairs.
Deletion of a key (and its associated value).
Searching for a value by key.
Displaying all key-value pairs in the hash table.

Challenge Points:

Designing an effective hash function to minimize collisions.
Implementing chaining correctly using linked lists within each bucket.
Managing dynamic memory for keys and entries to avoid memory leaks.
Handling cases such as inserting duplicate keys, deleting non-existent keys, and searching for keys not present in the table.
Ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations despite collisions.
