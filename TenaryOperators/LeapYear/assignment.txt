2. Checking If a Year Is a Leap Year Using Ternary Operator
Problem: Write a C function that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
Use a ternary operator to perform the leap year check.

Requirements:
Use the ternary operator to implement the logic for checking leap years.
The function should return 1 if the year is a leap year, and 0 otherwise.

Challenge Points:
Properly handling the leap year conditions with a ternary operator, including the special case for years divisible by 400.
Avoiding the use of if-else statements.
