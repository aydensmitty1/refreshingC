1. Finding the Maximum of Three Numbers Using Ternary Operator
Problem: Write a C program that takes three integers as input and 
uses a nested ternary operator to determine the largest of the three numbers.

Requirements:
Implement the function using a nested ternary operator to compare the three numbers.
The function should return the largest number.
Ensure that the program works correctly when two or all numbers are equal.

Challenge Points:
Using the ternary operator efficiently with nested conditions.
Handling equal numbers without using conditional statements (if-else).
