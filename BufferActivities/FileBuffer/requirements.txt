2. File Buffering with fread and fwrite
Prompt: Write a program in C that reads from one file and writes to another using buffer techniques. You must use fread and fwrite to perform buffered file I/O operations.

Use a buffer of a specific size (e.g., 1 KB).
Read from a source file into the buffer, then write the buffer contents to the destination file.
Ensure that the program handles large files efficiently and avoids memory overuse.
Requirements:

Implement error checking (e.g., file open failure, read/write failure).
Compare the execution time of reading/writing with and without buffering by timing both operations.
