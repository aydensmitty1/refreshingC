3. Linked List Node Insertion by Reference
Problem: Implement a function to insert a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list. The function should take the address of the head pointer and the new value to insert. 
Allocate memory for the new node and correctly update the list.

Function Prototype:
void insertAtHead(struct Node **head, int data);


Challenge Points:

Passing the head pointer by reference.
Correctly allocating memory for the new node and managing pointers.
Ensure there are no memory leaks.
