5. Matrix Transposition Using Dynamic Memory
Problem: Write a function that transposes a matrix dynamically allocated in memory. The matrix is represented as a 2D array (allocated as a single block of memory). 
The function should return a new transposed matrix and free the memory of the original matrix.

Function Prototype:
int** transposeMatrix(int **matrix, int rows, int cols);


Challenge Points:

Dynamically allocating and deallocating memory for both the original and transposed matrices.
Properly managing memory access in a 2D array represented by a 1D memory block.
Freeing the original matrix after transposition.
