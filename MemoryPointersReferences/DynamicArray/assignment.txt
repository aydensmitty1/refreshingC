1. Dynamic Array Resizing
Problem: Write a function that dynamically resizes an array. The function should take a pointer to the current array, its current size, and a new size. 
It should allocate a new array of the new size, copy the elements from the old array to the new array, and free the memory of the old array.

Function Prototype:
void resizeArray(int **arr, int currentSize, int newSize);


Challenge Points:

Managing memory allocation and freeing properly.
Handling cases where the new size is smaller than the current size.
